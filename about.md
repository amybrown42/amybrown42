# About me

## Bio

I am a Health Researcher in Townsville QLD, Australia. My research interests range from prostate cancer radiation therapy, patient preferences/perspectives and health technologies. I have a clinical background as a radiation therapist for over 10 years, and moved into full-time oncology research in 2018.
